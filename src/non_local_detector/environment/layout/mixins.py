class _KDTreeMixin:
    """
    Mixin providing point-to-bin mapping and neighbor finding using a KD-tree.

    This mixin uses a KD-tree built on bin centers for nearest-neighbor
    searches (`point_to_bin_index`) and a NetworkX graph for connectivity
    to find neighbors (`neighbors`).

    Assumes the inheriting class defines:
    - `self.bin_centers`: NDArray of active bin center coordinates.
    - `self.connectivity`: NetworkX graph of active bins.

    The `_build_kdtree` method must be called by the inheriting layout's
    `build` method after `bin_centers` is finalized.

    Attributes:
    ----------
    _kdtree : Optional[KDTree]
        KDTree for fast nearest-neighbor search.
    _kdtree_nodes_to_bin_indices_map : Optional[NDArray[np.int_]], shape (n_active_bins,)
        Maps KDTree node index to original source_index.

        Builds the KD-tree from `points_for_tree`.

        If `mask_for_points_in_tree` is provided, it's used to select a subset
        of `points_for_tree` to include in the KD-tree. The
        `_kdtree_nodes_to_bin_indices_map` will then map the KD-tree's
        internal node indices (0 to k-1) back to the original indices within
        `points_for_tree` that were selected by the mask.

        If `points_for_tree` are the layout's final `bin_centers` (which are
        all active), `mask_for_points_in_tree` should be `None` or all `True`.
        In this common case, `_kdtree_nodes_to_bin_indices_map` will effectively
        be `np.arange(len(points_for_tree))`.

        ----------
        points_for_tree : NDArray[np.float64], shape (n_total_points, n_dims)
